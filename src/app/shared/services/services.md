# Services

Use this directory for any [services](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt4) that are used throughout the application, especially when mocking an methods that hit an API. Make sure to unit test!

Another option would be mocking an API using [Angular in-memory-web-api](https://github.com/angular/in-memory-web-api).
